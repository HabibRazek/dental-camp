# Vercel Production Deployment Guide

## üöÄ Quick Deployment Steps

### 1. Environment Variables Setup
Set these in your Vercel dashboard:

```bash
# Required
DATABASE_URL="your-production-database-url"
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-production-secret-key"
NEXTAUTH_URL="https://your-domain.vercel.app"

# Optional (for email features)
SMTP_HOST="your-smtp-host"
SMTP_PORT="587"
SMTP_USER="your-smtp-user"
SMTP_PASS="your-smtp-password"
SMTP_FROM="noreply@your-domain.com"

# Optional (for file uploads)
UPLOADTHING_SECRET="your-uploadthing-secret"
UPLOADTHING_APP_ID="your-uploadthing-app-id"

# Build optimization
SKIP_ENV_VALIDATION="1"
```

### 2. Database Setup
1. Create a production database (PostgreSQL recommended)
2. Set the DATABASE_URL in Vercel
3. The build process will automatically run `prisma generate`

### 3. Build Configuration
The project is configured with:
- TypeScript strict mode with production optimizations
- Prisma client generation during build
- ESLint disabled during builds for faster deployment
- Webpack optimizations for server-side packages

### 4. Common Issues & Solutions

#### Build Errors
- Ensure all environment variables are set in Vercel dashboard
- Check that DATABASE_URL is accessible from Vercel
- Verify NEXTAUTH_SECRET is a secure random string

#### Runtime Errors
- Check Vercel function logs for detailed error messages
- Ensure database connection is working
- Verify all required environment variables are set

### 5. Performance Optimizations
- Images are optimized with Next.js Image component
- Static assets are cached
- API routes have 30-second timeout limit
- Prisma client is externalized for better performance

## üìù Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Set all required environment variables in Vercel
- [ ] Database is accessible and configured
- [ ] NEXTAUTH_URL matches your domain
- [ ] Test authentication flow
- [ ] Verify API routes are working
- [ ] Check image uploads (if using UploadThing)
- [ ] Test email functionality (if configured)

## üîß Troubleshooting

If deployment fails:
1. Check Vercel build logs for specific errors
2. Ensure all TypeScript errors are resolved
3. Verify environment variables are correctly set
4. Check database connectivity
5. Review function timeout limits for complex operations
