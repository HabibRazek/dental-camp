### 3. Configure Environment Variables
Add the following to your `.env` file:

```env
# UploadThing Configuration
UPLOADTHING_TOKEN="your_actual_token_here"
UPLOADTHING_APP_ID="your_actual_app_id_here"
```

### 4. Restart Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Alternative Solutions

If you prefer not to use UploadThing, you can:
1. Use AWS S3 with custom upload logic
2. Implement Cloudinary integration
3. Use Vercel Blob storage
4. Set up your own file server

The current fallback system makes it easy to swap out the upload provider while keeping the same UI/UX.
